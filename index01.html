        <p>That he really is different from other boys.
        As he is explaining this,full moon appears...Michael hides his face and the girl asks him why he is doing this. <br> When he looks back at her his face has changed! <br> He is suddenly looking like an anima, covered in hair, with elongated eyes and teeth like a wolf. <br> He's becoming werewolf! <br> pushes the girl away as she screams, and she turns and runs. <br>Michael reaches her, he is a werewolf. </p>
